# Idiomatic Survey
We parse the wiki-client/lib javascript and then interactively browse the abstract syntax trees
looking for idioms from a prior age better written using modern interfaces.

## Install
The program runs as a node/express server installed adjacent to the wiki-client codebase.
This is browsed from [localhost](http://localhost:1954/index) on port 1954.

```
mkdir temp
cd temp
git clone git@github.com:fedwiki/wiki-client.git
git clone git@github.com:WardCunningham/idiomatic.git
cd idiomatic
npm install
npm start
```

## History
This program has evolved through several iterations already and has not yet fully realized the vague ambition from which it began.
Ongoing history is sometimes recorded in the wiki page [Static Aspects](http://ward.dojo.fed.wiki/static-aspects.html) which does cite the localhost implementation.
